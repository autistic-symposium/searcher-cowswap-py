# ✨🐮 COWSOL: CoW Arbitrage Solver 👾✨ 

<br>

**This program implements a solver running arbitrage strategies for [CoW Protocol](https://github.com/cowprotocol).**

<br>

> *[Solvers](https://docs.cow.fi/off-chain-services/solvers) are a key component in the Cow Protocol, serving as the matching engines that find the best execution paths for user orders*.

<br>

For more details about this solver and CoW protocol in general, check [🐮✨bot #1: cowsol, an arb solver for CoW protocol](https://mirror.xyz/mevwaifu.eth/s_RwnRgJvK_6fLYPyav7lFT3Zs4W4ZvYwp-AM9EbuhQ).

## Current Strategies



### "no market maker" spread arbitrage

> Spread trades are the act of purchasing one security and selling another related security (legs) as a unit. 

<br>

* **One-leg limit price trade**.
    - In this type of order (*e.g.,* `orders/instance_1.json`), we have a limit price and one pool reserve (*e.g.*, `A -> C`).
* **Two-legged limit price trade for a single execution path**.
    - In this type of order (*e.g.*, `orders/instance_2.json`), we have a two-legged trade (*e.g.*, `A -> B -> C`), with only one option for each leg and it can be solved without any optimization.
* **Two-legs limit price trade for multiple execution paths**.
    - In this type of order (*e.g*., `orders/instance_3.json`), we have a two-legged trade (*e.g.*, `A -> B -> C`) with multiple pool reserves for each leg (*e.g.*, `B1`, `B2`, `B3`), so the order can be completed dividing it through multiple paths and optimizing for maximum total surplus.
<br>

## Implemented features 


### Liquidity sources

* Support for constant-product AMMs, such as Uniswap v2 (and its forks), where pools are represented by two token balances.


### Orders types


* Support for limit price orders for single order instances.
* Support for limit price orders for multiple orders on a single reserve instance.
* Support for limit price orders for multiple orders on multiple reserve instances.


<br>

## Execution specs


> A limit order is an order to buy or sell with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid or the minimum price to be received (the "limit price").

This limit determines when an order can be executed:

```
limit_price = sell_amount / buy_amount >= executed_buy_amount / executed_sell_amount
```

### Surplus

For multiple execution paths (liquidity sources), we choose the best solution by maximizing the *surplus* of an order:

```
surplus = exec_buy_amount  - exec_sell_amount / limit_price
```

### Amounts representation

All amounts are expressed by non-negative integer numbers, represented in atoms (*i.e.*, multiples of $10^{18}$). We add an underline (`_`) to results to denote decimal position, allowing easier reading.

<br>

---

## Order specs

User orders describe a trading intent.

### User order specs

* `sell_token`: token to be sold (added to the amm pool).
* `buy_token`: token to be bought (removed from the amm pool).
* `sell_amount`: limit amount for tokens to be sold.
* `buy_amount`: limit amount for tokens to be bought.
* `exec_sell_amount`: how many tokens get sold after order execution.
* `exec_buy_amount`: how many tokens get bought after order execution.
* `allow_partial_fill`: if `False`, only fill-or-kill orders are executed.
* `is_sell_order`: if it's sell or buy order.

<br>

### AMM exec specs


* `amm_exec_buy_amount`: how many tokens the amm "buys" (gets) from the user, and it's the sum of all `exec_sell_amount` of each path (leg) in the order execution.
* `amm_exec_sell_amount`: how many tokens the amm "sells" (gives) to the user, and it's the sum of all `exec_buy_amount` of each path (leg) in the order execution.
* `market_price`: the price to buy/sell a token through the user order specs.
* `prior_price`: the price to buy/sell a token prior to being altered by the order.
* `prior_sell_token_reserve`: the initial reserve amount of the "sell" token, prior to being altered by the order.
* `prior_buy_token_reserve`: the initial reserve amount of the "buy" token, prior to being altered by the order.
* `updated_sell_token_reserve`: the reserve amount of the "sell" token after being altered by the order.
* `updated_buy_token_reserve`: the reserve amount of the "buy" token after being altered by the order.

## Installing

### Install Requirements


```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
make install_deps
```

<br>

### Create an `.env`


```sh
cp .env.example .env
vim .env
```

<br>

### Install cowsol

```sh
make install
```

Test your installation:

```
cowsol
```


<br>

---

## Usage

### Listing available pools in an order instance file

```
cowsol -a <order file>
```
<br>

Example output:

```
🐮 AMMs available for orders/instance_1.json

{   'AC': {   'reserves': {   'A': '10000_000000000000000000',
                              'C': '10000_000000000000000000'}}}
```



<br>

### Listing orders in an order instance file

```
cowsol -o <order file>
```

<br>

Example output:

```
🐮 Orders for orders/instance_1.json

{   '0': {   'allow_partial_fill': False,
             'buy_amount': '900_000000000000000000',
             'buy_token': 'C',
             'is_sell_order': True,
             'sell_amount': '1000_000000000000000000',
             'sell_token': 'A'}}
```


<br>


### Solving a trade for one-leg limit price

```
cowsol -s orders/instance_1.json 
```

<br>

For example, for this user order instance:

<br>

```
{
    "orders": {
        "0": {
            "sell_token": "A",
            "buy_token": "C",
            "sell_amount": "1000_000000000000000000",
            "buy_amount": "900_000000000000000000",
            "allow_partial_fill": false,
            "is_sell_order": true
        }
    },
    "amms": {
        "AC": {
            "reserves": {
                "A": "10000_000000000000000000",
                "C": "10000_000000000000000000"
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Generates this output (logging set to `DEBUG`):

## Features to be added

### Strategies


* Add support for more than two legs.
* Add support for more than two pools on two-legged trade.
* Add multiple path graph weighting and cyclic arbitrage detection using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, so that we can optimize by multiple paths without necessarily dividing the order through them. This would allow obtaining arbitrage profit through finding profitable negative cycles (*e.g.*, `A -> B -> C -> D -> A`).


<br>

### Liquidity sources

* Add support for Balancer's weighted pools.
* Add support for Uniswap v3 and forks.
* Add support for stable pools.

<br>

### Code improvement

* Implement support for AMM fees.
* Add support for concurrency (`async`), so tasks could run in parallel adding temporal advantage to the solver.
* Benchmark and possibly add other optimization algorithms options.
* Add an actual execution class (through CoW server or directly to the blockchains).
* Finish implementing end-to-end BUY limit orders.
* Add unit tests.
